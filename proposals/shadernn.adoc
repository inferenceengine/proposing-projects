== Project Proposal Template


* Name of project -- or proposed name (must be unique within LF AI) :

ShaderNN – A mobile inference framework for convolutional neural network

* Requested project maturity level: 

Sandbox

* Project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history, ongoing development) :

  ShaderNN is a lightweight deep learning inference framework optimized for Convolutional Neural Networks. It provides high-performance inference for deep learning applications in image and graphics process on mobile devices. It uses texture-based input/output, which provides an efficient, zero-copy integration with real-time graphics pipeline or image processing applications, thereby saves expensive data transfers & format conversion between CPU and GPU which is critical for real time application on mobile platforms. It is built on native OpenGL ES (ShaderNN 1.0 ) and Vulkan (ShaderNN 2.0) graphics stack, which can be easily integrated with the graphics rendering pipeline to maximize the use of computing resources, suits for rendering, image/video and game AI applications.

* Statement on alignment with LF AI’s mission :

  ShaderNN falls within the mission of Deep Learning. This project provides a light weight inference framework for mobile image and graphics processing applications.
